Matchismo: Simple Matching Card Game
====================================


This is a simple matching card to learn the basics of iOS development.


##Game Rules

The rules are really simple.  
A set of 16 cards are displayed with the backs up on the table (four lines and
columns). Your objective is to match cards by suit or rank.
You can turn one card face up, look and turn it back with cost of 1 point. Once
you find a match, you can turn both cards face up and gain the respective
points for the match:

 * 8 points for matching cards of the same rank.
 * 2 point for matching cards of the same suit.

A mismatch of pair of cards will cost 1 point from you.

##Running the Game

2. Open the project on Xcode
3. Build and run on Simulator... yep, that's all. ;)
